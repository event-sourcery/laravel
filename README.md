# Laravel Driver for the Event Sourcery PHP CQRS / ES Library #

This is the Laravel driver for the [Event Sourcery](https://github.com/event-sourcery/event-sourcery) framework.

**Library is under conceptual development. Do not use.** 

This code is extremely proof-of-concepty. Once we work in production with it for a few months we'll have it cleaned up and documented.

# Installation #

`composer require event-sourcery/laravel`
